 * 2. TokenUsageChart showed judge tokens, not agent tokens (misleading)
 * 3. LatencyComparisonChart was redundant with trace-based duration
 *
 * The aggregate metrics chart now shows a normalized radar comparison at the top level,
 * and the per-use-case table provides detailed status/accuracy comparisons.
